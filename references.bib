	abstract = {Let K be an algebraically closed Ô¨Åeld of characteristic p. We exhibit a counterexample against a theorem asserted in one of our earlier papers, which claims to characterize the integral closure of K ((t)) within the Ô¨Åeld of Hahn‚ÄìMal‚Äôcev‚ÄìNeumann generalized power series. We then give a corrected characterization, generalizing our earlier description in terms of Ô¨Ånite automata in the case where K is the algebraic closure of a Ô¨Ånite Ô¨Åeld. We also characterize the integral closure of K (t), thus generalizing a well-known theorem of Christol and suggesting a possible framework for computing in this integral closure. We recover various corollaries on the structure of algebraic generalized power series; one of these is an extension of Derksen‚Äôs theorem on the zero sets of linear recurrent sequences in characteristic p.},

It develops the theory of pro-p groups of finite rank, starting from first principles and using elementary methods. Part {II} introduces p-adic analytic groups: by taking advantage of the theory developed in Part I, it is possible to define these, and derive all the main results of p-adic Lie theory, without having to develop any sophisticated analytic machinery. Part {III}, consisting of new material, takes the theory further. Among those topics discussed are the theory of pro-p groups of finite coclass, the dimension subgroup series, and its associated graded Lie algebra. The final chapter sketches a theory of analytic groups over pro-p rings other than the p-adic integers.},

This functor is the composition of a functor defined by Fargues-Fontaine from weakly admissible filtered (œÜ,N,{GK})-modules to {GK}-equivariant modifications of vector bundles over the Fargues-Fontaine curve {XFF} , with the functor of Fargues-Scholze that between the category of admissible modifications of vector bundles over {XFF} and the isogeny category of Breuil-Kisin-Fargues modules. We characterize the essential image of this functor and give two applications of our result. First, we give a new way of viewing the p-adic monodromy theorem of p-adic Galois representations. Also we show our theory provides a universal theory that enable us to compare many integral p-adic Hodge theories at the Ainf level.},

We do this via the theory of Fontaine‚Äôs (œï,ŒìK)-modules.¬∂This construction enables us to relate the theory of (œï,ŒìK)-modules to p-adic Hodge theory. We explain how to construct Dcris(V) and Dst(V) from D‚Ä†rig(V), which allows us to recognize semi-stable or crystalline representations; the connection is then unipotent or trivial on D‚Ä†rig(V)[1/t].¬∂In general, the connection has an infinite number of regular singularities, but V is de Rham if and only if those are apparent singularities. A structure theorem for modules over the Robba ring allows us to get rid of all singularities at once, and to obtain a ‚Äúclassical‚Äù differential equation, with a Frobenius structure.¬∂Using this, we construct a functor from the category of de Rham representations to that of classical p-adic differential equations with Frobenius structure. A recent theorem of Y. Andr√© gives a complete description of the structure of the latter object. This allows us to prove Fontaine‚Äôs p-adic monodromy conjecture: every de Rham representation is potentially semi-stable.¬∂As an application, we can extend to the case of arbitrary perfect residue fields some results of Hyodo (H1g=H1st), of Perrin-Riou (the semi-stability of ordinary representations), of Colmez (absolutely crystalline representations are of finite height), and of Bloch and Kato (if the weights of V are ‚â•2, then Bloch-Kato‚Äôs exponential {expVis} an isomorphism).},

The close connection between the absolute Galois groups of local number fields and local function fields in positive characteristic is established using the recent theory of perfectoid fields and the tilting correspondence. The author works in the general framework of Lubin‚ÄìTate extensions of local number fields, and provides an introduction to Lubin‚ÄìTate formal groups and to the formalism of ramified Witt vectors.

	abstract = {We want to determine all the extensions of a valuation ŒΩ of a Ô¨Åeld K to a cyclic extension L of K, i.e. L = K(x) is the Ô¨Åeld of rational functions of x or L = K(Œ∏) is the Ô¨Ånite separable extension generated by a root Œ∏ of an irreducible polynomial G(x). In two articles from 1936, Saunders {MacLane} has introduced the notions of key polynomial and of augmented valuation for a given valuation ¬µ of K[x], and has shown how we can recover any extension to L of a discrete rank one valuation ŒΩ of K by a countable sequence of augmented valuations ¬µi i‚ààI , with I ‚äÇ N. The valuation ¬µi is deÔ¨Åned by induction from the valuation ¬µi‚àí1, from a key polynomial œÜi and from the value Œ≥i = ¬µ(œÜi). In this article we study some properties of the augmented valuations and we generalize the results of {MacLane} to the case of any valuation ŒΩ of K. For this we need to introduce simple admissible families of augmented valuations A = ¬µŒ± Œ±‚ààA, where A is not necessarily a countable set, and to deÔ¨Åne a limit key polynomial and limit augmented valuation for such families. Then, any extension ¬µ to L of a valuation ŒΩ on K is again a limit of a family of augmented valuations.},

In this work we consider the case where X is the projective line and find purely valuation-theoretic criteria for the intersection properties of the special fiber of such a model and for the reduction of any closed point on the generic fiber. In the process, we describe and classify the pseudovaluations on the polynomial ring K[t] that extend the base field valuation in terms of their type and prove properties regarding the Berkovich projective line under very mild assumptions on the base field K (Henselian, discrete, the valuation ring is excellent). We also give proofs for classical results on fibered surfaces with regards to ample divisors, reduction and contraction.},

	abstract = {The Semistable Reduction Theorem by Deligne and Mumford states that any absolutely irreducible smooth projective curve over a field with a discrete valuation has a semistable model, at least if one admits a finite separable extension of the base field. The original proof does not provide a construction which can in practice be exploited to compute semistable models of curves. A recent proof of the Semistable Reduction Theorem by Arzdorf and Wewers uses techniques which are more accessible to algorithmic constructions. The present work makes several aspects of their approach explicit and realizes them in a computer algebra system. We represent models as finite sets of discrete valuations which correspond to the irreducible components of the special fiber. A theory by Mac Lane provides a compact representation of such valuations which is well suited for algorithmic considerations. In particular, it allows us to efficiently compute the normalization of a model of X in Y, i.e., the valuations which correspond to the normalization. From this we can also immediately deduce whether a model has reduced special fiber or not, a necessary condition for a model to be semistable. If the special fiber of a model is not reduced, then a theorem of Epp guarantees that there is a finite extension of the base field which makes it reduced. As Epp"s method is not fully constructive, we discuss alternatives to his approach. Using the theory of Mac Lane valuations, we provide a new algorithm to construct such an extension of the base field when working in mixed characteristic (0,p). Our algorithm is provably correct if p does only divide the degree of the cover of Y over X once. Assuming that the special fiber is reduced, we provide a new algorithm to compute equations for certain affine patches of the special fiber. Finally, we illustrate all the techniques developed in this work by computing semistable models in several examples.},

This point of view is used in the metabelian local class Ô¨Åeld theory of Koch and de Shalit and its generalization by Gurevich.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07216},
	abstract = {Let \$p\$ be a prime, \$K\$ a finite extension of \${\textbackslash}mathbb Q\_p\$, and let \$G\_K\$ be the absolute Galois group of \$K\$. The category of {\textbackslash}'etale \$({\textbackslash}varphi, {\textbackslash}tau)\$-modules is equivalent to the category of \$p\$-adic Galois representations of \$G\_K\$. In this paper, we show that all {\textbackslash}'etale \$({\textbackslash}varphi, {\textbackslash}tau)\$-modules are overconvergent; this answers a question of Caruso. Our result is an analogy of the classical overconvergence result of Cherbonnier and Colmez in the setting of {\textbackslash}'etale \$({\textbackslash}varphi, {\textbackslash}Gamma)\$-modules. However, our method is completely different from theirs. Indeed, we first show that all \$p\$-power-torsion representations admit loose crystalline lifts; this allows us to construct certain Kisin models in these torsion representations. We study the structure of these Kisin models, and use them to build an overconvergence basis.},

We also provide short and elegant probabilistic proofs of the latter, in terms of sums of discrete integer-valued random variables. Finally, we outline further identities for the partial Bell polynomials.},

Profinite groups are Galois groups. As such they are of interest in algebraic number theory. Much of recent research on abstract infinite groups is related to profinite groups because residually finite groups are naturally embedded in a profinite group. In addition to basic facts about general profinite groups, the book emphasizes free constructions (particularly free profinite groups and the structure of their subgroups). Homology and cohomology is described with a minimum of prerequisites. This second edition contains three new appendices dealing with a new characterization of free profinite groups, presentations of pro-p groups and a new conceptually simpler approach to the proof of some classical subgroup theorems. Throughout the text there are additions in the form of new results, improved proofs, typographical corrections, and an enlarged bibliography. The list of open questions has been updated; comments and references have been added about those previously open problems that have been solved after the first edition appeared.},

	abstract = {In mathematics, the cardinality of a set is a measure of the "number of elements of the set". For example, the set 
  
    
      
        A
        =
        \{
        2
        ,
        4
        ,
        6
        \}
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle A={\textbackslash}\{2,4,6{\textbackslash}\}\}
   contains 3 elements, and therefore 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle A\}
   has a cardinality of 3. Beginning in the late 19th century, this concept was generalized to infinite sets, allowing to distinguish several stages of infinity, and to perform arithmetic on them. There are two approaches to cardinality ‚Äì one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and another which uses cardinal numbers.
The cardinality of a set is also called its size, when no confusion with other notions of size is possible.
The cardinality of a set 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle A\}
   is usually denoted 
  
    
      
        
          {\textbar}
        
        A
        
          {\textbar}
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbar}A{\textbar}\}
  , with a vertical bar on each side; this is the same notation as absolute value and the meaning depends on context. Alternatively, the cardinality of a set 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle A\}
   may be denoted by 
  
    
      
        n
        (
        A
        )
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle n(A)\}
  , 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle A\}
  ,

        ‚Å°
        (
        A
        )

	abstract = {The classification of local Galois representations using (phi, Gamma)-modules by Fontaine has been generalized by Kisin and Ren [8] over Lubin-Tate extensions of local fields using the theory of (phi\_q, Gamma\_\{{LT}\})-modules. We extend the work of Herr [6] by introducing a complex which allows us to compute cohomology over Lubin-Tate extensions and compare it with Galois cohomology groups. That complex is further extended to include certain non abelian extensions. We also generalize the notion of (phi\_q, Gamma\_\{{LT}\})-modules over coefficient rings and build up to show the equivalence with Galois representations over R. This allows us to generalize our results to the case of coefficient rings.},

	abstract = {In a previous paper, we constructed a category of (œï, Œì)-modules associated to any adic space over Qp with the property that the ¬¥etale (œï, Œì)-modules correspond to ¬¥etale Qp-local systems; these involve sheaves of period rings for Scholze‚Äôs pro-¬¥etale topology. In this paper, we Ô¨Årst extend Kiehl‚Äôs theory of coherent sheaves on rigid analytic spaces to a theory of pseudocoherent sheaves on adic spaces, then construct a corresponding theory of pseudocoherent (œï, Œì)-modules. We then relate these objects to a more explicit construction in case the space comes equipped with a suitable inÔ¨Ånite ¬¥etale cover; in this case, one can decomplete the period sheaves and establish an analogue of the theorem of Cherbonnier-Colmez on the overconvergence of p-adic Galois representations. As an application, we show that relative (œï, Œì)-modules in our sense coincide with the relative (œï, Œì)-modules constructed by Andreatta and Brinon in the geometric setting where the latter can be constructed. As another application, we establish that the category of pseudocoherent (œï, Œì)-modules on an arbitrary rigid analytic space over a mixed-characteristic nonarchimedean Ô¨Åeld is abelian, satisÔ¨Åes the ascending chain condition, and is stable under various natural derived functors (including Hom, ‚äó, and pullback). Applications to the ¬¥etale cohomology of pro-¬¥etale local systems will be given in a subsequent paper.},

	abstract = {We describe a new approach to relative p-adic Hodge theory based on systematic use of Witt vector constructions and nonarchimedean analytic geometry in the style of both Berkovich and Huber. We give a thorough development of phi-modules over a relative Robba ring associated to a perfect Banach ring of characteristic p, including the relationship between these objects and etale Z\_p-local systems and Q\_p-local systems on the algebraic and analytic spaces associated to the base ring, and the relationship between etale cohomology and phi-cohomology. We also make a critical link to mixed characteristic by exhibiting an equivalence of tensor categories between the finite etale algebras over an arbitrary perfect Banach algebra over a nontrivially normed complete field of characteristic p and the finite etale algebras over a corresponding Banach Q\_p-algebra. This recovers the homeomorphism between the absolute Galois groups of F\_p((pi)) and Q\_p(mu\_\{p{\textasciicircum}infty\}) given by the field of norms construction of Fontaine and Wintenberger, as well as generalizations considered by Andreatta, Brinon, Faltings, Gabber, Ramero, Scholl, and most recently Scholze. Using Huber's formalism of adic spaces and Scholze's formalism of perfectoid spaces, we globalize the constructions to give several descriptions of the etale local systems on analytic spaces over p-adic fields. One of these descriptions uses a relative version of the Fargues-Fontaine curve.},

It takes values in a mixed-characteristic analogue of Dieudonn¬¥e modules, which was previously deÔ¨Åned by Fargues as a version of Breuil‚ÄìKisin modules. Notably, this cohomology theory specializes to all other known p-adic cohomology theories, such as crystalline, de Rham and ¬¥etale cohomology, which allows us to prove strong integral comparison theorems.},

In this article we generalize Fontaine‚Äôs result to the case of arbitratry Lubin-Tate towers L‚àû over Ô¨Ånite extensions L of Qp by using the Kisin-Ren/Fontaine equivalence of categories between Galois representations and (œïL, ŒìL)-module and extending parts of [Her], [Sch]. Moreover, we prove a kind of explicit reciprocity law which calculates the Kummer map over L‚àû for the multiplicative group twisted with the dual of the Tate module T of the Lubin-Tate formal group in terms of Coleman power series and the attached (œïL, ŒìL)-module. The proof is based on a generalized Schmid-Witt residue formula. Finally, we extend the explicit reciprocity law of Bloch and Kato [{BK}] Thm. 2.1 to our situation expressing the Bloch-Kato exponential map for L(œáLr T ) in terms of generalized Coates-Wiles homomorphisms, where the Lubin-Tate characater œá{LT} describes the Galois action on T.},

We give h√®re an explicit construction of th√© cohomology groups of a Zp-adic repr√©sentation of {GK} killed by a power of p, using th√®se new objects. When K is a finite extension of Qp, we show then how one can find again Tate's classical results about th√®se groups : th√© finiteness and th√© calculation of th√© Euler-Poincar√© characteristic. Th√© methods used seem to be rather simpler than th√© standard cohomological arguments because we don't need sophisticated th√©ories like local class field theory and everything is essentially explicit. One gets aiso interesting information about th√© structure of th√© modules associated with repr√©sentations and a 3-step filtration on their Galois cohomology.},
